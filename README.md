## The Mission
For the average consumer it is currently too difficult to invest in sustainable house upgrades. Mapping out your house to find potential weakspots in your house's insulation is a pricey endeavor. DuraFlip strives to remove that obstacle almost entirely, by allowing homeowners to analyze their property by themselves without the need of a consultant.

## The Concept
We have an interactive proof of concept, to showcase the user experience. 

## The Backend
DuraFlip would make use of the BAG Kadaster API. This allows us to receive basic information abou the building, while the user only needs to give their address. This streamlines the process and keeps users more focused on the end goal.

## Contents
The repository contains an artists impression of our concept app. And a python script which demonstrates how the backend of the app would function.
